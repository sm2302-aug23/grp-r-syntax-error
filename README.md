#Task 5 

In this question we are trying to find the trend or relation between prime numbers with its parity in collatz sequence. To analyse the data and to look for the trend sort out the prime numbers from collatz_df, by creating a function to sort out the prime numbers. After running the code we found out after the number 2 all of the prime number's parity is odd. Only prime number 2 has even parity. After analysing the table again, we found out the there is alot of repeating maximum value, such as the number 52 and 9232. But in the table number 9232 keeps popping up. In visualisation the collatz conjecture the connecting lines will mostly go to number 9232. When arranging the collatz conjecture diagram just like in the assignment page ( The circle diagram for collatz conjecture ) there will be many numbers connected to the number 9232 where as the maximum value always pops up the number 9232.
